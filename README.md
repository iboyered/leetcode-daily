# leetcode-daily
Uploading my solutions for the daily leetcode challenges.

### Overview
Hello! In this repository, I will be collecting my work, solutions, and submissions for daily leetcode challenges so that I can refer back to them at a later date.

Code may be messy and full of comments. If this were production code, I would clean it up, but I want to document my thought process working through the problem so I can learn as much as possible, and code as if I were explaining the solution to someone else.

For now, files will be sorted by the problem number, but I may change the organizational system at a later date.
